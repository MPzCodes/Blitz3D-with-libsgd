if you have a new Blitz3D v1.118 version you can load the libsgd file as runtime.dll here


The runtime.dll.old file is the original Blitz3d_v1.119 dll file with DX7
The runtime.dll file is the libsgd for Blitz3d_v1.119 dll file with DX11/12

you can copy the runtime.dll.old file to runtime.dll to use the orignal version
